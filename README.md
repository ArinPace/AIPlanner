# AI Planner

A local React + TypeScript planner with Calendar and Files workspaces.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite, then sign in or create an account. Accounts and data are saved on this computer in the project's `data/` directory. The Vite development and preview servers both include the local API; opening `dist/index.html` directly does not provide persistence.

## Files

Choose **Files** in the header, then create a folder. Folders support names, custom colors, comma-separated labels, and nesting. Open a folder to:

- Create and edit plain text files; click **Save text file** to persist edits.
- Upload PDF documents up to **25 MB** and download the original PDF later.
- Save web links with a title and open them in a new tab.
- Rename and move items using their editor's folder selector.

Use **Edit folder** to change a folder's name, color, labels, or parent. Folder moves cannot create cycles. Search scans names, labels, text contents, and saved URLs across folders; PDF contents are not indexed. Filter by folder label and sort by name or recent updates. Deleting a folder removes its subfolders and all their items after confirmation. Text edits stay open when switching workspace tabs; leaving the editor, closing the page, or logging out prompts when there are unsaved edits.

## Storage

- `data/users.json` and `data/sessions.json`: existing account/session storage.
- `data/calendars/<username>.json`: calendar events and settings.
- `data/files/<username>.json`: folder tree, text files, saved links, and PDF metadata.
- `data/uploads/<username>/<document-id>.pdf`: uploaded PDF bytes.

Files endpoints require the existing signed-in session. Uploading, downloading, moving, or deleting items affects only that account. Keep the `data/` directory when moving or backing up the app. Calendar and Files are saved independently.

## Checks

```sh
npm run build
npm run lint
```
